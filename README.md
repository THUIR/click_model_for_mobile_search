# Click Models for Mobile Search 

Thanks for visiting.

This project focuses on building click models for mobile search.

It is based on the project by Aleksandr Chuklin (https://github.com/varepsilon/clickmodels).

# Format of the Input Data (Click Log)

A small example can be found under ``data/train``. This is a tab-separated file, where each line has 10 elements. A record of a query session is shown as follows:

```
0032202F707D59045B51569FA5952795#1#1533349671#5#0	快递单号查询	0	0.0	["http://www.guoguo-app.com", "https://m.ickd.cn/", "http://m.ickd.cn/", "http://m.kuaidi100.com/", "http://m.kuaidi100.com/", "http://www.chawuliu.cn/", "http://www.17ckd.com/", "http://wap-hint/", "http://www.sogou.com/", "http://m.aikuaidi.cn", "http://wap.yto.net.cn/", "http://www.sf-express.com/mobile/cn/sc/index.html", "http://www.sogou.com/"]	["21194401", "-1", "-1", "-1", "30000909", "-1", "-1", "30010081", "50023801", "-1", "-1", "30000909", "50023901"]	[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]	[30000, 30000, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]	[20333, 2055, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]	[345, 157, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]
```

1. ``0032202F707D59045B51569FA5952795#1#1533349671#5#0`` contains the hashid and beginning timestamp of the session (currently not used in MCM and VTCM).

2. ``快递单号查询`` is the query of the session.

3. A integer identifier which represent the user's region (currently not used in MCM and VTCM).
4. The probability $P(I = V)$ that the user has a vertical intent $V$ (currently not used in MCM and VTCM).

5. A list of the URLs of the documents that make up SERP (search engine result page).

6. A list with the presentation types (vertical types) of the documents.

7. A list of user clicks.

8. A list of raw viewport time.

9. A list of viewport time weighted by the result height and viewport height.

10. A list of result heights.


# Usage

## Click prediction

You can train and test a click model with given example data:
```default
python test_click_models.py ../data/train ../data/test -m MCM-VPT -N 1 -M 1 -o ../mcm_mr --ignore_no_clicks --ignore_no_viewport --viewport_time
```

``-m``: The click model that you would like to run, such as MCM-VPT (VTCM), MCM, and other popular click models.
``-N``: The number of files that you would like to use for training in the train dictionary.
``-M``: The number of files that you would like to use for test in the test dictionary.
``-o``: The path to output dictionary.
``--ignore_no_clicks``: Ignore the sessions that don't contain any click.
``--ignore_no_viewport``: Ignore the sessions that don't contain viewport time information
``--viewport_time``: Read viewport time information of train and test dataset.


## Relevance estimation

You can get the relevance scores estimated by click models based on the outputs of click prediction:
```default
python get_ranking_from_relevance_estimation.py ../mcm_mr/relevance_estimation.txt ../mcm_mr/ranking_relevance_estimation.txt -n 10 -m MCM
```
